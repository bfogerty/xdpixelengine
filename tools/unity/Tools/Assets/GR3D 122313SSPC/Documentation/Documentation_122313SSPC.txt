Vehicle Reference: McLaren MP4-12C
Build Date: 12.23.13
Series: Street Super Car (SSPC)

Mesh/Geometry				Triangles

Mesh 122313SSPC
This specific mesh contains the following sub-objects:
body, Whl RL, Whl RR, Whl FL, Whl FR.
Drawcalls: 8

Mesh 122313SSPC_v2
This specific mesh contains the following sub-objects:
body, Whl RL, Whl RR, Whl FL, Whl FR, headlights, engine bay.
Drawcalls: 10

Optional
Overall polygon/triangle count of mesh 122313SSPC_v2 can be further reduced by removing the following sub-objects: head lights, engine bay. With these sub-objects removed, 122313SSPC-glass material must use the car/body shader (or any other non-transparent diffuse shader).  Use 122313SSPC_glass.psd as a template to create a texture image for the glass material.

Importing to Unity 3D

Importing a Unity Package: 
* Open a new project or an existing one
* Assets-->Import Package-->Custom Package-->
GR3D_122313SSPC.unitypackage
* Import into project
* GR3D 122313SSPC folder imported into project/scene.

FBX Importer Setting

Scale Factor: .01 **
Mesh Compression: off
Normals: Import **
Tangents: Calculate **
Split Tangents: Checked

** These settings are very important when re-importing FBX into Unity

Special Note

The default Brake Light texture image (122313SSPC_color of car) is clear LED.  This texture image can be modified by opening .PSD file (122313SSPC_main), disabling "clear led lights" layer, and enabling "red led lights" layer. Resave file as .png format.
